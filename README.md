# currency-calc
My idea is a Currency converter. I love to travel, but sometimes using exchange rates can be a little confusing, however with this currency converter it would be much easier. I would like to focus on USD to a couple of Caribbean islands such as Haiti, Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados, and maybe Trinidad and Tobago. These islands are much smaller than the US and although they are not as wealthy they have people travel to them all the time and I feel like this is something that would incorporate my major of Finance with the currency and love for coding by using Python.
